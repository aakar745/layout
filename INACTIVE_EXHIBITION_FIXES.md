# Inactive Exhibition Fixes

## Summary

Fixed the Active/Inactive status functionality to ensure that deactivated exhibitions (`isActive: false`) are completely hidden from all public views and show appropriate error messages when accessed via direct links.

## Problem

Previously, the system was only checking `status: 'published'` but not the `isActive` field for public access, which meant that inactive exhibitions could still be accessed via direct links or appear in public listings.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Public Controller (`backend/src/controllers/public.controller.ts`)

**Fixed Functions:**
- `getPublicExhibitions()` - Added `isActive: true` filter
- `getPublicExhibition()` - Added `isActive: true` filter  
- `getPublicLayout()` - Added `isActive: true` filter
- `getPublicStallDetails()` - Added `isActive: true` filter
- `bookPublicStall()` - Added `isActive: true` filter
- `bookPublicMultipleStalls()` - Added `isActive: true` filter

**Before:**
```javascript
const exhibitions = await Exhibition.find({ status: 'published' })
```

**After:**
```javascript
const exhibitions = await Exhibition.find({ 
  status: 'published',
  isActive: true 
})
```

**Error Messages Updated:**
- Changed from "Exhibition not found" to "Exhibition not found or no longer available"

#### 2. Exhibitor Booking Controller (`backend/src/controllers/exhibitorBooking.controller.ts`)

**Fixed Function:**
- `createExhibitorBooking()` - Added `isActive: true` filter for exhibition lookup

**Before:**
```javascript
exhibition = await Exhibition.findOne({ slug: exhibitionId });
```

**After:**
```javascript
exhibition = await Exhibition.findOne({ slug: exhibitionId, isActive: true });
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Public Layout View (`frontend/src/components/exhibition/public_view/PublicLayoutView.tsx`)

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Added detection for "not available" errors
- Updated error messages to be more user-friendly
- Changed status from "error" to "404" for inactive exhibitions

**Before:**
```javascript
<Result
  status="error"
  title="Failed to load exhibition layout"
  subTitle={error || "The exhibition layout couldn't be loaded."}
/>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<Result
  status={isNotAvailable ? "404" : "error"}
  title={isNotAvailable ? "Exhibition No Longer Available" : "Failed to Load Exhibition"}
  subTitle={
    isNotAvailable 
      ? "This exhibition is no longer available or has been deactivated. It may have been removed by the organizer."
      : (error || "The exhibition layout couldn't be loaded. Please try again later.")
  }
/>
```

#### 2. Public Exhibition Details (`frontend/src/components/exhibition/public_view/PublicExhibitionDetails.tsx`)

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Added similar error detection and messaging improvements
- Consistent user experience across all public views

### Test Script

Created `test-inactive-exhibition.js` to verify the functionality:
- Tests public exhibitions endpoint filtering
- Tests 404 responses for inactive exhibitions
- Tests booking endpoint blocking
- Verifies error message content

## Behavior After Fixes

### For Inactive Exhibitions (`isActive: false`):

1. **Public Exhibition List** - Completely hidden from `/api/public/exhibitions`
2. **Direct Access** - Returns 404 with message "Exhibition not found or no longer available"
3. **Layout View** - Returns 404 with user-friendly error message
4. **Booking Attempts** - Blocked with 404 error
5. **Exhibitor Booking** - Blocked with 404 error

### For Admin Users:

- Can still see all exhibitions (active and inactive) in admin panel
- Can toggle `isActive` status to reactivate exhibitions
- Full access to manage inactive exhibitions

### Error Messages:

- **Backend**: "Exhibition not found or no longer available"
- **Frontend**: "Exhibition No Longer Available" with explanation about deactivation

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Create an exhibition and set it to `isActive: false`
2. Try accessing it via:
   - Public exhibition list
   - Direct URL with exhibition ID/slug
   - Layout view
   - Booking endpoints
3. All should return 404 with appropriate messages

## Impact

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Admin access preserved for all exhibitions
- ✅ Improved user experience with clear error messages
- ✅ Complete isolation of inactive exhibitions from public access
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all public endpoints

# Exhibition Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of exhibition-scoped access control in the Exhibition Management System. The solution ensures users can only access bookings from exhibitions they are specifically assigned to.

## Problem Solved
Previously, users with the same role (e.g., "Sales") could see each other's bookings across different exhibitions. Now, access is restricted based on exhibition assignments.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Model Updates
**File:** `backend/src/models/exhibition.model.ts`
- Added `assignedUsers: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]` array
- Added performance indexes for efficient queries

### 2. API Endpoints
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/exhibition.controller.ts`
- `POST /exhibitions/:id/assign-users` - Assign users to exhibition (admin only)
- `DELETE /exhibitions/:id/unassign-users` - Unassign users from exhibition (admin only)
- `GET /exhibitions/:id/assigned-users` - Get assigned users for exhibition (admin only)

**File:** `backend/src/routes/exhibition.routes.ts`
- Added protected routes for user assignment management

### 3. Access Control Logic
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/booking.controller.ts`
- Added `isAdminUser()` helper function
- Added `getUserAccessibleExhibitions()` helper function
- Modified booking queries to filter by accessible exhibitions
- Admin users bypass restrictions, regular users see only assigned exhibitions

### 4. User Management
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`
- Enhanced `createUser` to handle exhibition assignments with bidirectional sync
- Enhanced `updateUser` to handle exhibition assignments with bidirectional sync
- Maintains referential integrity between users and exhibitions

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Services
**File:** `frontend/src/services/user.service.ts`
- Updated `User` interface to include `assignedExhibitions?: string[]`
- Updated `CreateUserData` interface to include `assignedExhibitions?: string[]`

**File:** `frontend/src/services/exhibition.ts`
- Added `assignUsersToExhibition()` function
- Added `unassignUsersFromExhibition()` function  
- Added `getAssignedUsers()` function

### 2. User Management Components
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/users/NewUserModal.tsx`
- Added exhibition assignment dropdown with multi-select
- Fetches and displays available exhibitions
- Includes assigned exhibitions in user creation

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/users/EditUserModal.tsx`
- Added exhibition assignment dropdown with multi-select
- Pre-populates with existing assignments
- Includes assigned exhibitions in user updates

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/users/ViewUserModal.tsx`
- Added "Assigned Exhibitions" section to user details
- Displays exhibition assignments with tags

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/users/index.tsx`
- Added "Assigned Exhibitions" column to users table
- Shows exhibition assignments with truncation for large lists

### 3. Redux Store
**File:** `frontend/src/store/slices/userSlice.ts`
- Updated to handle `assignedExhibitions` in user operations
- Maintains state for exhibition assignments

## Key Features

### 1. Admin Access Control
- Admins have full access to all exhibitions and bookings
- Only admins can assign/unassign users to exhibitions
- Admin status determined by role name containing "admin"

### 2. User-Centric Assignment
- Users can be assigned to multiple exhibitions
- Assignments are managed through user creation/editing
- Bidirectional sync maintains data integrity

### 3. Access Filtering
- Booking queries automatically filter by user's assigned exhibitions
- No additional frontend filtering required
- Transparent to existing booking management workflows

### 4. Performance Optimized
- Database indexes for efficient exhibition assignment queries
- Minimal impact on existing functionality
- Scalable design for large numbers of users and exhibitions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ✅
- Database schema updates
- API endpoints for assignment management  
- Access control logic in booking controllers
- User management enhancements

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration ✅
- User interface updates for exhibition assignment
- Service layer enhancements
- Redux store updates
- Component integration

## Backwards Compatibility
- Existing users without assignments continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Gradual migration path available
- Admin users maintain full access

## Security Considerations
- Exhibition assignments validated on backend
- Admin-only assignment management
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Data integrity maintained through bidirectional sync

## Testing
- Comprehensive access control verification
- User assignment functionality testing
- Edge cases handled (no assignments, admin bypass)
- Integration testing across components

## Future Enhancements
- Exhibition-specific role assignments
- Bulk user assignment tools
- Assignment history tracking
- Advanced permission granularity

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Exhibition access control fully implemented and tested
**Next Steps:** Deploy to staging environment for user acceptance testing

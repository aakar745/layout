# PhonePe Development Mode Configuration
# Use this configuration for testing while your real credentials are being activated

# Replace these values in your .env file:
PHONEPE_CLIENT_ID=phonepe_test_development_mode
PHONEPE_CLIENT_SECRET=test_secret
PHONEPE_CLIENT_VERSION=1
PHONEPE_ENV=SANDBOX

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy these values to your main .env file
# 2. Restart your backend server: npm run dev
# 3. Test the service charge payment flow
# 4. Payments will be simulated (no real money involved)
# 5. Switch back to real credentials once PhonePe activates them

# What happens in development mode:
# - No real API calls to PhonePe
# - Payment flow is simulated
# - All features work normally
# - Safe for testing and development
